# Crypto Dating


## 1 Introduction
Crypto Dating is an attempt to address some of the problems with relationship matching using technology and ideas related to the blockchain. 
While we will propose a specific implementation, theoretically this can also be viewed as a protocol, or template, for apps to follow.

### 1.1 Vision
Fixing the idea of dating seems truly an ambitious undertaking.

### 1.2 Background
Anyone who has attemped online or app dating (and even general dating before that) understands the a person's true feelings can often times be at odds with their unwillingess to be honest.
For example, John may really like Betty, but Betty might just not be into John. Since John is a nice guy she talks to him for a while and drags it out, but ultimately their relationship fails to progress.
Both sides can agree, honesty is the best result here. Even if John will be heartbroken because he thinks he found his soulmate, if he can find out sooner instead of wasting so much time, it will prove better for him.
But most people inheritenly hate to see some else discomforted by something they have done, and thus we face this issue where we subsitute honesty for 'kindness'.
The solution to this problem is rooted in lessons from Bitcoin, blockchain, decentralization, and trustless systems.
